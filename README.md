# A very simple bash script for fetching a weather report for your location

## Dependencies:

[jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq) $-$ a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor.

## Notes:
API keys are intentionally left right in the script as variables. A reason for this is to provide user with better customization possibilities.
